#Project Description
Develepers Best Friend!

This application includes both a Lorem Ipsum generator, and a fake user generator.  Both can be reached from the main landing page.
 

#Details for Teaching Team

*No login required
*Tools require user to select and copy results

#Items for next version

* Add a horizontal nav bar
* Options for outputting files
